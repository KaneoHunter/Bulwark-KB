##### Q: How many coins for a Masternode, and how do I set one up?

A: 5000 BWK, Check out the pinned messages on #masternodes for a setup guide from our developer Stu.

##### Q: What is a shared Masternode, and how do I get in one?

A: Users can pool their funds to gather up the 5000 BWK required to operate a masternode. Shared masternodes are trust based and require that you trust the node operator not to take your funds. The Bulwark Team does not support or endorse any masternode operator and advises caution to anyone considering participating in a shared masternode group.

##### Q: How much does a Bulwark Masternode make?

A: Masternode profits vary on the price of the coin, what percent of rewards the nodes get, and how many are online. You can check out these websites for that information:

##### Q: Is my Masternode running?

A: A good way to check to see if your masternode is running is to make sure it says “Enabled” in the wallet, and then checking the Masternodes list on the block explorer to see if you are on it.

##### Q: How long does it take to get your first Masternode reward?

A: It can take upwards of 30 hours to receive your first Masternode reward after it's fully activated, which takes 24 hours. The times will increase overtime, as more Masternodes come online.
