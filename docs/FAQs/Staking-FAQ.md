# Staking FAQ

##### Q: When does staking begin?

A: Staking begins on block 182700, the 1st block to be rewarded to a staker will be block 182701.

This is estimated to be on the 20th of June, around 8pm (UTC+2), but this time can change dependent on development decisions or block times.

To calculate to estimated time to POS: ((182701-<current block height>)*1.5)/60=hours to POS

##### Q: Does my wallet need to be open in order to receive staking rewards?

A: Yes, your wallet will need to be opened and unlocked in order to be able to receive staking rewards.

##### Q: Do I need to put anything in my Bulwark.conf to enable staking?

A: No, the wallet v1.3.0 has a "Enable Staking" button on the bottom, which you will need to press to enable staking.

##### Q: How much BWK do I need to stake?

A: The minimum denomination of BWK you can submit to stake is 1 BWK.

Each 1 BWK on top of this increases your chance to find the next block and gain the reward + fees.

##### Q: Whats the most efficient amount to stake every day?

A: There is no "most efficient amount" to stake. The reason for this, is much like for mining there isn't a "most efficient" hashrate, the more Bulwark you stake, the more rewards you will receive. Similarly, by staking very few coins (or having a lower hashrate) doesn't mean you are being inefficient, it means it will just take you longer to find blocks. In theory, staking even 1 BWK will get you a reward proportionally to your share of the total number of staked coins over time.

##### Q: How long do coins have to mature before they can be staked?

To be eligible for staking, coins must have 66 confirmations, which takes roughly 100 minutes. Also, the transaction that sent them must be older than 60 minutes.
