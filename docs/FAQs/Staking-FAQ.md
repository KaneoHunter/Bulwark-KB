# Staking FAQ

##### Q: When does staking begin?

A: Staking begins on block 182700, the 1st block to be rewarded to a staker will be block 182701.

This is estimated to be on the 19th of June, around 11pm (UTC+0), but this time can change dependent on development decisions or block times.

To calculate to estimated time to POS: ((182701-<current block height>)*1.5)/60=hours to POS

##### Q: Does my wallet need to be open in order to recieve staking rewards?

A: Yes, your wallet will need to be open and enabled for staking in order to find blocks.

##### Q: Do I need to put anything in my Bulwark.conf to enable staking?

A: No, in the wallet release that moves/moved staking up there will be a neat button on the front page of your wallet that will enable staking.

##### Q: How much BWK do I need to stake?

A: The minimum denomination of BWK you can submit to stake is 1 BWK.

Each 1 BWK on top of this increases your chance to find the next block and gain the reward + fees.

##### Q: Whats the most efficient amount to stake every day?

A: There is no "most efficient amount" to stake. The reason for this, is much like for mining there isn't a "most efficient" hashrate, the more Bulwark you stake, the more rewards you will receive. Similarly, by staking very few coins (or having a lower hashrate) doesn't mean you are being inefficient, it means it will just take you longer to find blocks. In theory, staking even 1 BWK will get you a reward proportionally to your share of the total number of staked coins over time.

##### Q: How long do coins have to mature before they can be staked?

To be eligible for staking, coins must have 66 confirmations, which takes roughly 100 minutes. Also, the transaction that sent them must be older than 60 minutes.
