# Staking Guide

1. Make sure you have the latest wallet version downloaded from our [Github](https://github.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark/releases) and the wallet is fully synced with a balance of atleast 1 BWK.
2. Now you press on "Enable Staking" and type in your password (if set, which is highly recommended.).
3. If everything worked, the Staking-Icon on the bottom right should turn dark blue and say "Staking status:true". But not only the staking status needs to be true, the other points except multisend should be marked as "true" aswell in order to be able to stake.

Please keep in mind, that it can take up to a few minutes for the Staking-Icon to turn dark blue and display "Staking Status:true".
