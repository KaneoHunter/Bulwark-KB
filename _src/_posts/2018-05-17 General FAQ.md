Q: What is the block time, and how many blocks are there in a day?
A: The target block time is 90 seconds, which puts BWK at about 960 blocks per day.

Q: Is Bulwark just a fork of PIVX?
A: Bulwark is forked off of an older, more stable version of PIVX. We then hand patched it up to PIVX 2.3,
and then backported code from Bitcoin 0.13 and DASH 12.1. A more detailed explanation is available in the Whitepaper.
