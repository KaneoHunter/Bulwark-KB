**Q:** *What is the block time, and how many blocks are there in a day?*

**A:** The target block time is 90 seconds, which puts BWK at about 960 blocks per day.

**Q:** *Is Bulwark just a fork of PIVX?*

**A:** Bulwark is forked off of an older, more stable version of PIVX. We then hand patched it up to PIVX 2.3,
and then backported code from Bitcoin 0.13 and DASH 12.1. A more detailed explanation is available in the Whitepaper.

**Q:**  *Does Bulwark plan to be listed on [Exchange] any time soon?*

**A:**  The Bulwark team is committed to the long-term health and stability of this project.  Major exchanges want to see novel features
and longevity from non-ICO coins prior to listing.  Bulwark is focused on  executing in both of those areas, but we are not actively pursuing additional exchange listings at this time.

**Q:** *How many coins for a Masternode, and how do I set one up?*

**A:** 5000 Bulwark, Check out Setup Guide and associated script on our [Official Github](https://github.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark-MN-Install).

**Q:** *How much does a Bulwark Masternode make?*

**A:** Masternode profits vary on the price of the coin, what percent of rewards the nodes get, and how many are online. You can check out these websites for that information:

**Q:** *How can i mine Bulwark?*

**A:** Currently, you can either use a pool like [Mining-Dutch](https://www.mining-dutch.nl/) and use their auto-convert feature to have whatever you mine paid out in Bulwark,
or use a Baikal x10 FPGA to mine Bulwark until we switch to Proof of Stake.
