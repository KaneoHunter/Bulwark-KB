## When does staking begin?

Staking begins on block 182700, the 1st block to be rewarded to a staker will be block 182701.

This is estimated to be on the 19th of June, around 11pm (UTC+0), but this time can change dependent on development decisions or block times.

To calculate to estimated time to POS:

((182701-<current block height>)*1.5)/60=hours to POS
