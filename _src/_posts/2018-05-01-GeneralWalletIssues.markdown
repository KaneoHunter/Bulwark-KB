1. Make sure you are running the Wallet Version 1.2.4 and your wallet is closed.
2. Now you head over to the Bulwark folder (How to do that is guided below)
3. Delete all files except ```wallet.dat```, ```bulwark.conf```, ```masternode.conf``` and the backups folder.

_Press Windows+R and write %appdata%_

* **Linux:** ~/.bulwark/
_Navigate to the .bulwark folder in your home directory_
