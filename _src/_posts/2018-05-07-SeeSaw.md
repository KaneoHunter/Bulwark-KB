We have decided to utilize the SeeSaw reward system popularized by PIVX (Jakiman 2017). The SeeSaw reward system begins with a 9:1 block reward ratio (favoring masternodes), and smoothly adjusts the ratio of reward between staking and node operators until around 41.5% of coins in circulation are locked into masternodes,
at which time staking rewards reach a slight advantage over masternode rewards on a coin-by-coin basis.

The reason we have the SeeSaw slightly favoring staking rewards is because we want to avoid the problems - like significant price volatility and low liquidity - that impact coins with very-high percentages of their circulating supply locked in nodes. This strategy will mitigate user frustration over access to coin supply and maintains the relevance of our robust network. With one of our goals being a well-supported platform for anonymous commerce, transactability is of the utmost importance to those accepting Bulwark and those holding Bulwark.
