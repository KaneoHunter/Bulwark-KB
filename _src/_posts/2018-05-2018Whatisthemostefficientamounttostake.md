## Whats the most efficient amount to stake every day?

There is no "most efficient amount" to stake. The reason for this, is much like for mining there isn't a "most efficient" hashrate, the more Bulwark you stake, the more rewards you will receive. Similarly, by staking very few coins (or having a lower hashrate) doesn't mean you are being inefficient, it means it will just take you longer to find blocks. In theory, given enough time, staking even 1 BWK will get you a reward proportionally to your share of the total number of coins being staked.
