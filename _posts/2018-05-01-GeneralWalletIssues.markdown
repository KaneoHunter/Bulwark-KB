#### General Issues with the Wallet

1. Make sure you are running the Wallet Version 1.2.4 and your wallet is closed.
2. Now you head over to the Bulwark folder (How to do that is guided below)
3. Delete all files except ```wallet.dat```, ```bulwark.conf```, ```masternode.conf``` and the backups folder.

How to find your Bulwark folder:

**Windows**: Press Windows+R and write %appdata%

**macOS**: Press Command+Space to open Spotlight, write ~/Library/Application Support/Bulwark and press Enter.

**Linux**: Open ~/.bulwark/
